It gives undocumented immigrants protection from deportation and a work permit that is renewed every two years. She's lived in Arizona with her family but after grduating from high school she got engaged and planned to marry. However, the day before her wedding she was arrested at work for using false documents when a worksite raid was conducted by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Ivon was later charged for falsing documents in Arizona, which is a felony. Now she's ineligible for DACA and can't apply for legalization. She's now facing deportation and the pain of being permanently seprated from her family.</h1>
